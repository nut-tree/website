# Point

When navigating your screen, nut.js relies on the [`Point`](https://nut-tree.github.io/apidoc/classes/point.html) datatype to represent points in 2D space.

A [`Point`](https://nut-tree.github.io/apidoc/classes/point.html) is a simple data structure holding an `x` and `y` coordinate.

## Sample

```js
const p = new Point(10, 100);

console.log(p);
```
